# Crowdfunding-analysis
 
The purpose of this analysis was to structure the raw data given to us in a readable format to draw out conclusions for the client.
Analysis was performed using filters, pivot tables, charts, and formulas
Challenges for this project included filtering out useful info from irrelevant info, experimenting with the pivot table to produce the most readable data, and drawing out unbiased conclusions from the data 
The most successful theater campaigns were launched in the month of May, and by December the amount of successful campaigns were about the same at the amount of failed campaigns. 
The conclusion that can be drawn from Outcomes Based on Goals is that the goals less than $1,000 have a high chance of success and the higher the goal the higher the chance of failure with a 0% chance of success from $45,000 to $50,000.
Some limitations of the data set include lack of information before 2011, irrelevant data not useful for the client, and limitations to only seeing campaign results from Kickstarter without exploring other campaign platforms.
One chart that could be made is outcomes based on average donation and filter for categories and goal, to see how much average donation is given for each subcategory and goal amount.
